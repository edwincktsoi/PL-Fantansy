# 🏆 Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Strategy Guide — Moneyball Edition

Building a successful Premier League Fantasy Football (FPL) team involves balancing value, fixtures, form, rotation, and long-term planning. This guide provides a data-driven, strategic approach to help you manage your team like a pro—or a Moneyball manager.

---

## ⚙️ 1. Set Your Goals

- 🎯 Define your objective: win a mini-league, finish in the top 10k, beat your friends?
- 🔁 Determine risk appetite:
  - Safe points = template picks
  - High upside = differentials (low ownership, high ceiling)

---

## 🧱 2. Squad Structure (Budget Allocation)

### 💰 Suggested Breakdown (for £100M budget):
- **Goalkeepers:** £8.5–9.0M total (e.g., £4.5M + £4.5M)
- **Defenders:** £25–26M (1–2 premiums + 3–4 budget picks)
- **Midfielders:** £36–38M (your biggest investment area)
- **Forwards:** £27–29M (1 premium, 1 mid-priced, 1 enabler)

### ✅ Formation Tips:
- **3-5-2** or **3-4-3** are most effective.
- Avoid spending heavily on all three forwards early on.

---

## 🧠 3. Core Selection Principles

### ✅ A. Form + Fixtures + Minutes
- Use **Fixture Difficulty Rating (FDR)** to spot good runs.
- Pick players who are nailed for **80+ minutes** per game.

### ✅ B. Set Pieces and Penalty Takers
- Target cheap players on **corners, free-kicks, or pens** (e.g., Maddison, JWP).

### ✅ C. Team Quality
- **Attackers** from attacking teams (e.g., Man City, Arsenal).
- **Defenders** from clean sheet teams (e.g., Newcastle, Liverpool).

---

## 📊 4. Use Underlying Stats

Don’t rely on past points alone — trust the data.

### For Attackers:
- **xG (Expected Goals)**
- **Shots in the box**
- **Touches in the penalty area**
- **Chances created**

### For Defenders:
- **Clean sheets**
- **Bonus Point System (BPS) potential**
- **Attacking threat** (headers, assists, set pieces)

---

## 🔁 5. Rotation Strategy

- Rotate cheap **defenders** and **goalkeepers** based on fixtures.
- Ensure **2 bench players** are regular starters.

---

## 💎 6. Find Value (Moneyball Style)

Look for underpriced players based on their roles or positions:
- Example: A £5.5M **midfielder playing as a forward**.
- Track **newly promoted team stars** or **position changes**.

---

## 🧮 7. Captaincy Planning

- Always have **1–2 premium players** for reliable captaincy.
- Plan 4–6 Gameweeks ahead to rotate captain choices.

---

## 📅 8. Plan for Wildcards & Chips

| Chip           | Best Use Case                                                  |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Wildcard**   | GW5–8 (early injuries/team shake-up) or GW18–20 (fixture shift) |
| **Bench Boost**| When all 15 players have matches (esp. during double GWs)      |
| **Triple Captain** | Use on a premium player with a favorable double GW        |
| **Free Hit**   | Use during blank/double GWs to field a full squad              |

---

## 🧠 Final Tips

- ❌ Don’t chase last week’s points — follow the data.
- 👀 Watch pre-season for player form, fitness, and minutes.
- 🗞️ Stay updated on injury/team news every Friday.
- 🧘‍♂️ Be patient — **consistency > punting**.
